## üîß Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem #1: Ubuntu Kept Asking Me to Install Again

**What happened?**  
Every time I booted into Ubuntu, it would ask me to install it again like nothing ever happened üò©

**What I tried:**
- ‚úÖ Changed the **boot order** so that the hard disk came first
- ‚úÖ Switched the disk from ISO to "normal" after installation
- ‚úÖ Tried enabling **floppy disk** in boot order (didn't help but worth trying)
- ‚ùå Removed duplicate Ubuntu entries in boot menu (this broke everything)

**Solution:**
1. **Remove the ISO after installation**: Settings > Storage > Remove Ubuntu ISO
2. **Fix boot order**: Settings > System > Boot Order > Hard Disk first
3. **Don't delete boot entries** unless you know what you're doing

---

### Problem #2: Guest Additions Nightmare

**What happened?**  
Tried installing Guest Additions from VirtualBox menu (`Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image`) but got:

```bash
Could not mount the media/drive 'VBoxGuestAdditions.iso' (VERR_PDM_MEDIA_LOCKED)
```

**What I tried (and failed):**

```bash
# This got stuck at the second line
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
sudo apt install gcc make perl
```

```bash
# This froze Ubuntu at 47% during "Unboxing VirtualBox"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso virtualbox-guest-utils
sudo reboot
```

**What actually worked:**
- Gave up on Guest Additions üôÉ
- Manually adjusted resolution: **Settings > Display > Resolution** in Ubuntu
- Not perfect, but functional enough

**Alternative solution to try:**
```bash
# If you want to attempt Guest Additions again
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-generic
# Then insert Guest Additions CD and run autorun.sh
```

### Moving Ubuntu VM from C: to D: Drive

**Problem:**  
Ran out of space on C: drive (literally 0 bytes), got I/O cache errors:
```
The I/O cache encountered an error while updating data in medium "ahci-0-0" (rc=VERR_DISK_FULL)
```

**Solution Steps:**
1. **Move VM folder**: Cut entire VM folder from `C:\Users\[Username]\VirtualBox VMs\Ubuntu` to `D:\VirtualBox VMs\Ubuntu`
2. **Handle saved state issues**: Delete `.sav` files if VM was in saved state
3. **Force quit VirtualBox** via Task Manager if it freezes
4. **Remove broken VM entry**: Machine > Remove (keep files)
5. **Re-add VM**: Machine > Add > Select `.vbox` file from new location
6. **Update storage paths**: Settings > Storage > Point to D: drive paths
7. **Set new default folder**: File > Preferences > General > Default Machine Folder ‚Üí `D:\VirtualBox VMs`
8. **Create snapshot**: Take snapshot after successful move

## ‚úÖ What Eventually Worked for Me

Final working configuration:
- Manual resolution adjustment in Ubuntu settings
- Storage set to "normal" (not ISO)
- Boot order: Hard disk first
- ISO removed after installation
- VM moved to D: drive with proper path updates

---

## üîÆ What I'll Do Next Time

- Try **Ubuntu Minimal install** to save resources
- **Take snapshots** immediately after successful install
- Consider **VMware Player** as alternative
- **Allocate more disk space** initially (30-40 GB)
- **Enable hardware acceleration** if available

## ‚ö° TL;DR Quick Fixes

| Problem | Quick Solution |
|---------|----------------|
| Ubuntu keeps asking to install | Remove ISO, fix boot order |
| Guest Additions won't install | Skip it, use manual resolution |
| VM running out of space | Move to different drive, update paths |
| VM won't boot after changes | Check storage paths, remove saved states |
| Poor performance | Allocate more RAM, enable hardware acceleration |
